## PS03: Demeaning

Suppose we have the following model:

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i
$$

Before running a regression of $Y_i$ on $X_i$, you decided to demean each variable by subtracting off the mean from each observation. This gave you $\tilde{Y_i} = Y_i - \bar{Y}$ and $\tilde{X_i} = X_i - \bar{X}$. The estimation equation becomes:

$$
\tilde{Y_i} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \tilde{X_i} + v_i
$$

where $v_i = u_i - \bar{u_i}$.

[Show:]{.note} $\alpha_0 = 0$ and $\alpha_1 = \beta_1$
