## Gauss-Markov Theorem

> OLS is the [Best Linear Unbiased Estimator]{.hi} ([BLUE]{.hii}) when the following assumptions hold:

. . .

[A1.]{.note} [Linearity:]{.hi} The population relationship is [_linear in parameters_]{.note} with an additive error term.

[A2.]{.note} [Sample Variation:]{.hi} There is variation in $X$.

[A3.]{.note} [Exogeniety:]{.hi} The $X$ variable is [exogenous]{.note} 

[A4.]{.note} [Homoskedasticity:]{.hi} The error term has the same variance for each value of the independent variable 

[A5.]{.note} [Non-autocorrelation:]{.hi} The values of error terms have independent distributions
