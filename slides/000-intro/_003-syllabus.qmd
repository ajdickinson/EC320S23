## In EC 320

<br>

We start to build up the fundamentals of [causal analysis]{.blue}

<br>

But first we need to build up the necessary [Theory]{.hi}, [Tools]{.hii}, and [Skills]{.hp}

<br>

This course will focus _almost_ exclusively on a particular method that is common in statistics in general:

. . .

<br>

- [Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)]{.note} [(aka linear regression)]{.tiny}

## Course site

I use [GitHub]{.mono} to host a separate site with all the course materials

You can find a link to it [here](https://github.com/ajdickinson/EC320S23) or on the Canvas homepage

. . .

<br>

I use it because:

1. it is convenient for me to post slides
2. it allows me to post class materials on my website
3. acts as a secondary site in case Canvas poops out

. . .

[EVERYTHING](.hi) will be posted to both Canvas and GitHub except one thing... [the slides]{.fragment}

. . .

All zoom records will only be available on Canvas

## In EC 320

An applied econometrician^[Applied econometrician = Practitioner of econometrics, e.g., analyst, consultant, data scientist.] needs a solid grasp on (at least) three areas:

1. The underlying [theory]{.hi} (assumptions, strengths, weaknesses).
1. An ability to load, aggregating, joining, visualizing [large datasets]{.hi}.
1. [Applying]{.hi} the theoretical methods to [actual data]{.hi}.

. . .

This course aims to deepen your knowledge in each of these three areas.
