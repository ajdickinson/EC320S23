## What is [R]{.mono .realbig}?

To quote the [[R]{.mono .big} project website](https://www.r-project.org)^[[[R]{.mono} wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))]

> R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

. . .

What does that mean?

- [R] was created for the statistical and graphical work required by econometrics--written by statistical programmers

- [R]{.mono .big} has a vibrant, thriving online community. ([stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r))

- Plus it's __free__ and __open source__.

## Why are we using [R]{.mono .realbig}?

1\. [R]{.mono .big} is [free]{.hi} and [open source]{.hi}â€”saving both you and the university money.

<br>

2\. _Related:_ Outside of a small group of economists, private- and public-sector [employers favor [R]{.mono .big}]{.blue} over [Stata]{.mono} and most competing softwares.

<br>

3\. [R]{.mono .big} is very [flexible and powerful]{.hi}â€”adaptable to nearly any task, _e.g._, 'metrics, spatial data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, data cleaning, website building, teaching. I write all my slides, problem sets, and exams in [R]{.mono .big}.

## Why are we using [R]{.mono .realbig}?

4\. _Related:_ [R]{.mono .big} imposes [no artificial restrictions]{.hi} on your amount of observations, variables, memory, or processing power.

<br>

## [R]{.mono .realbig} setup for EC 320

### Installation

You need to install [2]{.hi} pieces of software:

- [[R]{.mono .big}](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [[Rstudio]{.mono}](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

. . .

For explicit instructions for how to install, follow [this tutorial](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-welcome)

## R basics

You will dive deeper into R in lab, but here six big points about R:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}

1. Everything is an __object__.

1. Every object has a __name__ and __value__.

1. You use __functions__ on these objects.

1. Functions come in __libraries__ (__packages__)

1. R will try to __help__ you.

1. R has its __quirks__.

::: {.column width="35%"}

`foo`

`foo <- 2`

`mean(foo)`

`library(dplyr)`

`?dplyr`

`NA; error; warning`
