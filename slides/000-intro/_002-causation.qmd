## Causal identification

Common refrain.^[[Ex.]{.ex} [Number of people who drowned by falling in pool and Nicolas Cage films](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)]

> "Correlation does not necessarily imply causation."

<br>

. . .

Why might correlation fail to describe a causal relationship?

## Causal identification{data-visibility="uncounted"}

Common refrain.^[[Ex.]{.ex} [Number of people who drowned by falling in pool and Nicolas Cage films](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)]

> "Correlation does not necessarily imply causation."

. . .

Correlation may imply causation if we assume ["all else equals"]{.note}

- Hold everything fixed

. . .

This assumption is fragile in the real world.

## Experiments

How can we ensure the [all else equals]{.blue} assumption holds?

. . .

> Randomization

. . . 

[Randomized Controlled Trails]{.hii} (RCT)

- widely used across many scientific disciplines^[Medicine, psychology, education, agronomics among many others]
- often touted as the _gold standard_ of causal identification
- use [randomization]{.blue} to ensure [all else equals]{.blue}

. . .

In 2019, the Nobel Prize winners adapting RCTs to projects in development economics^[Duflo, Banerjee, and Kremer]

## Experiments [Ex.]{.ex}

[Research question]{.hi}

> _Does health insurance improve health?_

. . .

The [all else equals]{.hi} assumption would require:

- all preexisting correlates with health must be the same across insured and uninsured

. . .

What would violate this assumption?

. . .

> _If more money is correlated with better health, and the average income of those who buy health insurance is higher, then we violate this assumption_

---

## Experiments [Ex.]{.ex}

_But what if health insurance is randomly assigned?_

- Then, assuming the assignment is perfectly random across a large enough sample size, this assumption becomes much more palatable

> [The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment is a landmark study of the effect of expanding public health insurance on health care use, health outcomes, financial strain, and well-being of low-income adults... In 2008, the state of Oregon drew names by lottery for its Medicaid program for low-income, uninsured adults, generating just such an opportunity. This ongoing analysis represents a collaborative effort between researchers and the state of Oregon to learn about the costs and benefits of expanding public health insurance.]{.tiny}

## Natural experiments

. . .

> An external, non-experimental factor creates circumstances that resemble a controlled experiment

. . .

<br>

Real-world events provide opportunity to compare similar groups

<br>

With some assumptions, researchers infer the causal relationships examining differences in outcomes between groups

## Natural experiments

Any examples of [natural experiments]{.note} that come to mind?

. . .

Here are some of the more famous ones:


1. Vietnam draft lottery

::: {.notes}
During the Vietnam War, the U.S. used a lottery system to determine which young men would be drafted into military service. The random assignment of draft numbers created a natural experiment that researchers have used to study the causal effects of military service on various outcomes, including earnings, education, and long-term health.

. . .

2. The Mariel Boatlift

::: {.notes}
The Mariel Boatlift: In 1980, Fidel Castro unexpectedly allowed around 125,000 Cubans to leave for the United States, creating a sudden increase in the supply of low-skilled labor in Miami. This "supply shock" has been used as a natural experiment to study the effects of immigration on the wages and employment opportunities of native workers in the receiving country.

. . .

3. Divorce Law Reforms

::: {.notes}
In the 1970s and 1980s, several U.S. states adopted "no-fault" divorce laws, which made it easier for couples to obtain a divorce without having to prove fault or misconduct by either spouse. These reforms created a natural experiment to study the effects of divorce law changes on marriage and divorce rates, labor force participation, and outcomes for children in affected families.
:::

. . .

4. The Opening of the London Congestion Charge

::: {.notes}
In 2003, London introduced a congestion charge for vehicles entering the city center during peak hours. The charge aimed to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. The introduction of the charge provided a natural experiment to study its effects on air pollution, traffic congestion, and public transportation use.

::: {.notes}
Each data point shown in Top indicates total daily fishing hours per 1,000 km2 within the PIPA (red) and Kiribati control (blue) regions during the January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016 period. These high-frequency observations are aggregated from GFW’s boat-level data, which use various classification algorithms to assign boat activity as either “fishing” or “not-fishing” (12). January 1, 2015 marks the first date of PIPA implementation (dashed vertical line). September 1, 2013 corresponds to the earliest mention of a possible full closure of PIPA to fishing according to global Google search activity for the terms “Phoenix Islands Protected Area” and “closure” (19). To reduce noise, we fit a restricted cubic spline (solid lines) to flexibly model the relationship between fishing effort and time separately for each region and for the periods before and after PIPA implementation. Our spline functions use six evenly spaced knots (25).

We highlight three results from Fig. 3. First, trends in fishing effort from January 2012 to August 2013 in PIPA and the Kiribati control regions are parallel and nearly identical. Furthermore, there appears to be no change in fishing effort for the Kiribati control region after August 2013. This suggests that fishing around the Line and Gilbert Islands serves as a reasonable control for fishing in PIPA. Second, consistent with the presence of a blue paradox, there is a clear divergence in fishing effort after public awareness about the closure began to grow (around September 1, 2013) and before the start of PIPA implementation on January 1, 2015. While we cannot directly measure boat captains’ expectations about a possible future closure, this surge in preemptive fishing within PIPA relative to the control region occurred presumably because fishing vessels anticipated the eventual arrival of the marine reserve before its implementation. Third, fishing in PIPA falls to nearly zero after the marine reserve is established, consistent with previous literature (11, 12), but fishing in the control region is little affected. This again confirms the validity of our control area.

Fig. 3, Bottom examines whether this difference in preemptive fishing is statistically significant. It shows the estimated restricted cubic spline function for the difference in fishing effort across the PIPA and control regions (see Eq. 1 in Materials and Methods). The associated 90% CI, which is robust to serial correlation and heteroscedasticity of arbitrary form within a 60-d time window (26), shows that this difference in fishing before PIPA implementation is statistically significant for the period starting late 2013 until PIPA implementation.

[Discussion]{.hi}

Results provide causal evidence that commercial fishers engage in preemptive behavior in response to conservation policy changes.

Results are *consistent* with economic theory, but *cannot prove* that the theory is correct.

- Science [cannot prove]{.hi} anything.
- Science can [falsify or reject]{.note} existing hypotheses or [corroborate]{.note} existing evidence.

## Natural experiments [Ex.]{.ex}

Furthermore, the causal statement rests on a critical assumption.

- Cannot prove that the assumption is true, but can falsify it.
- Failure to falsify $\neq$ assumption is true.
